The words Bahire Hasab originate from the ancient language of Ge'ez, ( Arabic: Abu Shakir) is a time-tracking method, devised by the 12th pope of Alexandria, Pope St. Dimitri. This package allows developers to implement Ethiopian Calendar and Datetime System in their application(s)`. This package is implemented using the UNIX EPOCH which means it's not a conversion of any other calendar system into Ethiopian, for instance, Gregorian Calendar. Unix Epoch is measured using milliseconds since 01 Jan, 1970 UTC. In UNIX EPOCH leap seconds are ignored. Client Implementations JSON:API has a great advantage in that since its standardised, API-agnostic tools can be made to abstract away the semantics of consuming and working with the data. It is recommended that you use a JSON:API client to implement the Kitsu API for this reason. Many implementations in over 13 languages can be found on the JSON:API website .
